## 0.37.0 (Dec 31, 2024)
  * Add a `dig` option for traversing into a template.
    It's basically an alias of the already existing `search` option.
  * Drop support for Rails 6.

## 0.36.0 (Nov 21, 2024)

New features `extract!`, `partial!`, and test improvements.

## 0.35.0 (Jul 20, 2024)

Fix issue with locals referring to an earlier item when using it in collections.

## 0.34.0 (May 31, 2024)

Fix issue with `send_data` not working due to the `layout_patch` not accounting for
inline templates.

## 0.32.0 (Dec 9, 2023)

Revert the removal of virtual_path_of_template, and renamed it to
`active_template_virtual_path`. The reason for the removal was because we tried
to replace it with "#{controller_path}/#{action_name}" in superglue for the
component identifier, but that proved a bit too hairy. We also expose the
method to all other template types as well, as using @virtual_path on HTML erbs
from the view seemed too private.

## 0.31.0 (Dec 6, 2023)

* PropsTemplate no longer adds a virtual_path_of_template method to your views.
This is used by Superglue's generated `application.json.props`. This is a backward
breaking change. To migrate, simply change the `componentIdentifer` in your
`application.json.props` and update the `page_to_page_mapping.js` accordingly.

````
json.componentIdentifier "#{controller_path}/#{action_name}"
````

## 0.30.0 (Nov 25, 2023)

* PropsTemplate will no longer automatically `camelize(:lower)` on keys.
Instead, be explicit about the keys we're serializing.

For example: `json.currentUser` instead of `json.current_user`. This
is backward breaking. To retain the current behavior, you can do this:

```
module PropsTemplateOverride
  def format_key(key)
    @key_cache ||= {}
    @key_cache[key] ||= key.camelize(:lower)
    @key_cache[key]
  end

  def result!
    result = super
    @key_cache = {}
    result
  end

  ::Props::BaseWithExtensions.prepend self
end
```

## 0.24.0 (Nov 4th, 2023)
  * Turn the local assigns `virtual_path_of_template` that didn't work into a method on the view

## 0.23.0 (Jun 28, 2023)
  * Fix #1 issues templates without layouts were not rendering
  * Refactor layout_patch to make a less invasive monkey patch
  * Add ruby standard
  * Add CONTRIBUTING.md

## 0.21.1 (Jan 6, 2022)
  * Add support for Rails 7

## 0.21.0 (Jan 3, 2022)
  * rename bzq to props_at

## 0.20.0 (June 6, 2021)
  * Added testing for Ruby 3.0
  * Moved PropsTemplate to own repo
  * Use version.rb instead of VERSION file.
